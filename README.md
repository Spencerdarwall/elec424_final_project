# 🏎️ ELEC 424 - Final Project: Self-Driving Car (Raspberry Pi Version) 🚗

## 🌟 Project Overview
Welcome to our undergraduate final project for ELEC 424, focusing on developing a self-driving car using a Raspberry Pi 4. Our mission is to transform a standard RC car into an autonomous vehicle capable of making its own navigational decisions. 🤖

## 🎯 Project Goals
Here are our exciting project objectives:

1. **🛣️ Lane Keeping**: Implement an algorithm that enables the car to autonomously follow a defined lane using computer vision techniques.

2. **🛑 Stop Box Recognition**: Program the car to recognize and stop at red stop boxes placed on the track.

3. **🏁 Speed Control**: Utilize an optical speed encoder to maintain consistent speed and enhance the car's navigational accuracy.

4. **🧪 Performance Testing**: Test the car on designated tracks to evaluate and refine its performance for optimal functionality.
